## 🧠 About This Project
**“Driving Simulator”** is the first milestone in my journey as a Unity 3D developer, created through Unity's **Create With Code** learning pathway.

This prototype features a player-driven truck navigating a scenic highway, dodging randomly placed crates and obstacles. While simple at heart, it laid the foundation for my understanding of Unity’s scripting, physics, and camera control systems.

> ✅ This isn’t just a tutorial-followed build. It's an intentional first step toward mastering indie game development.

## 🔧 Core Features

- 🚗 **Player Vehicle Control** — Arrow key truck movement using `Rigidbody`
- 📦 **Obstacle Behavious** — Random crate/obstacles placed along the path to either hit or avoid
- 🎥 **Follow Camera** — Smooth camera tracking for immersive perspective
- 💥 **Collision Handling** — Crates despawn on exit; obstacles cause game over
- 🌄 **Minimalist Aesthetic** — Clean low-poly art style and smooth movement
